It allows educational institutions and corporate organizations to conduct examinations from any geographical location, requiring only a device with a stable internet connection. The core components of these systems include a question bank, a secure browser, and, most importantly, artificial intelligence (AI) enabled remote proctoring to prevent malpractice and ensure academic integrity. The advantages are vast, including instantaneous results and automatic grading, which drastically reduce the administrative workload on faculty. Furthermore, it is a highly economical and environmentally friendly solution, as it eliminates costs related to printing papers, setting up, and managing physical examination centers. With features like randomized questions, webcam monitoring, and screen locking, modern systems are highly secure. Although technical issues such as internet connectivity problems or digital literacy gaps can pose challenges, the efficiency and convenience offered by online exams make them a crucial tool in the modern education landscape. These platforms provide comprehensive reports and data-driven insights into student performance.</font></p></p>
