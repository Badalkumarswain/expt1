    <h1>Welcome to CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the "skin" of the web, responsible for the visual presentation and layout of a website. While HTML provides the skeleton (structure), CSS transforms it into a polished, user-friendly interface. 
The importance of CSS in modern web development can be categorized into several key areas:
1. Separation of Content and Design
CSS allows developers to separate a website's content (HTML) from its visual style. 
Cleaner Code: By moving styles to a separate file, HTML remains focused on structure, making it more readable and easier to manage.
Easy Maintenance: You can change the entire look of a website by updating a single external stylesheet rather than editing every individual page. 
2. Responsive and Adaptive Design
With the variety of devices used today, CSS is critical for making websites work on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. 
Media Queries: These allow you to apply different styles based on screen size, ensuring the site is usable regardless of the device.
Modern Layouts: Tools like Flexbox and CSS Grid provide powerful ways to create complex, flexible layouts that adjust dynamically. 
3. Performance and Efficiency
CSS significantly improves how a website loads and functions. 
Faster Loading Times: Browsers download CSS rules once and cache them. When a user visits other pages on the same site, the browser doesn't need to reload the styling, speeding up navigation.
Reduced Bandwidth: External stylesheets lead to smaller HTML files, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network. 
4. Enhanced User Experience (UX)
A well-styled website is more than just "pretty"it is functional and accessible. 
Visual Hierarchy: CSS helps guide users' eyes to the most important information through font sizes, colors, and positioning.
Interactivity: You can add animations, hover effects, and smooth transitions to make the site feel responsive and engaging without needing heavy JavaScript.
Accessibility: CSS allows for better contrast, readable font sizing, and "print-friendly" styles, making the web more inclusive for users with disabilities. 
5. SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Clean, well-organized CSS can positively impact your search engine rankings. 
Lighter Code: Search engine "spiders" can crawl lean HTML content more easily when it isn't cluttered with inline styling.
Page Speed: Since loading speed is a ranking factor for Google, the performance benefits of CSS directly support SEO efforts.
